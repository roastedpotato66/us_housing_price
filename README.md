# US housing price and racial demographics 
This project examines the relationship between racial demographics and housing prices. 

I was inspired to start this project after the Texas government proposed a bill to ban Chinese citizens from buying property in January 2023, citing national security concerns. I wanted to explore how changes in the population of Asians and other racial groups affect housing prices. I obtained most of my data from the United States Census Bureau and began by analyzing trends at the county level before focusing on cities. 

I completed the initial draft of this project in February 2023, and the bill was ultimately defeated in the Texas House in May of the same year.
